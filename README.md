# osdc-scripts
Experimental scripts to differentially copy a whole OS over SSH using Rsync

These scripts were used to test the principle of copying the whole OS from inside a VM to
another VM differentially using Rscync over SSH.

This makes possible to move a VM between different cloud providers and even solutions without using
the API of the providers.
